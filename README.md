# Password Generator: Javascript

## Project Description

Creating a password generator that will select a random combination of characters based on what criteria the user has input. These unpredictable passwords will provide greater security for all of your personal, sensitive information. I wanted to achieve this functionality through my use of JavaScript. This project involved alot of troubleshooting, trial & error and problem solving.

## Tasks

## The Website

---

The website has a simple, userfriendly interface. Clicking the 'generate password' button provides you with a variety of criteria that you can select from to determine your password. Choosing from Numbers, Uppercase characters,Lowercase characters and Special characters to make sure you are given a password that suits your security level requirements. The website also encourages larger than 8 and less than 128 characters for your password. The website also gives you a warning pop up to alert you when you have forgotten to enter any fields.
